-My adventure (2D Platformer)  
My first try. I followed the lecture by Brackeys and simply "copied" most of the contents. Just to hve some fun. All the asserts are also from Brackey.

-Dodge the Creeps (2D Endless Avoider)  
Similar to My Adventure, I followed the instructions in Godot ducuments and "copied" the whole game. I got to roughly understand how Godot works.

-Survive school (2D Platformer)
I came up with some funny ideas about my homework and thus tried to make this game. The idea was big but I didn't have enough time to finish it. (I really had much homework to do.)
Original art by me (pixel art). 
DeepSeek taught me a lot.
